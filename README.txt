Assignment 5C: Dog Park

Welcome to my dog park! Here you will find various dogs, various different-shaped dog toys, and some obstacles. Clifford the big red dog makes an appearance too!

You may rotate the world by clicking the mouse and dragging it across your screen. Use your mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/out of the world.

Included are some controls for the lighting in the world.

The project may take up to 10 seconds to fully load.


Notes to grader: Most code based off of threejs.org guides that were linked on assignment 5.B instructions. ChatGPT sometimes helped me learn, debug and get unstuck with my code, and I made comments in my code indicating where it was used. Also recieved help from a course tutor. 

A course tutor and chatGPT helped me get my assignment to show on a full screen for the website.

Old Asgn3B Notes: I was able to get my 3 different types of light sources in my implementation (ambient, directional, rectArea) but I could't figure out how to seperate the controls on my html page correctly. I was able to get the 3 light sources on my implementation with just the three.js.org guides, but I tried asking chatgpt for help on fixing the lighting controls on the top right corner (not part of the assignment) after meeting with various course tutors on how to fix it but they didn't know. The GUI implementations (for lighting controls) are a mix of three.js.org code and chat gpt suggested code that didn't really work every even after hours of trying to debug. I ended up not being able to fix the lighting controls, but I did all of the required points for 5B.
